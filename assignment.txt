Question: Describe and discuss the use case of following:
->

   1. fork()
      The fork() system call is a fundamental operation in operating systems. It is used to create a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is called the child process, while the calling process is referred to as the parent process.
      Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the parent process. After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call.

   2. exec()
      exec is a functionality of an operating system that runs an executable file in the context of an already existing process, replacing the previous executable.
      It is used to replace the current shell process with a new process. This means that when you use the 'exec' command, the current shell process terminates, and a new process starts.

   3. getpid()
      The getpid() function is simple to use and does not take any arguments. It returns the PID of the process that calls it.
      When a parent process creates a child process using fork(), it can use getpid() and getpid() which gets the parent process ID) to manage and coordinate between the two processes.

   4. wait()
      The Wait() function in operating systems is used by a parent process to wait for its child processes to terminate. When a parent process calls wait(), it pauses execution until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received.
      In scenarios where a parent process spawns multiple child processes, wait() helps manage the lifecycle of each child process by waiting for their termination one by one.

   5. stat()
      The stat() function in operating systems is used to retrieve information about a file or directory. It provides details such as the file's size, permissions, owner, and timestamps. This function is commonly used in file management and system programming.
      The stat() function retrieves the status of a file and stores it in a structure, which contains various fields representing different attributes of the file.

   6. opendir()
      The opendir() function in operating systems is used to open a directory stream. This directory stream can then be used to read the contents of the directory using other functions ike readdir() and to close the directory stream with closedir().
      opendir() is commonly used in utilities that need to manage or analyze directory contents, such as backup tools, file managers, or custom scripts.

   7. readdir()
      The readdir() function in operating systems is used to read directory entries from a directory stream opened with opendir(). It allows you to iterate through the contents of a directory and retrieve information about each file or subdirectory within it.

   8. close()
      The close() function in operating systems is used to close a file descriptor, which is an integer handle used by the operating system to identify an open file, socket, or other I/O resource. Closing a file descriptor releases the associated resources and marks it as no longer in use.
